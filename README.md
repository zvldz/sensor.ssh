Login to a remote server via ssh, execute a command and retrieve the result as sensor value

To get started download
```
/custom_components/ssh/__init__.py
/custom_components/ssh/manifest.json
/custom_components/ssh/sensor.py

```
into
```
<config directory>/custom_components/ssh/
```

**Example configuration.yaml:**

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: ssh
      host: !secret proxmox_host
      name: 'NUC CPU Temp'
      username: !secret proxmox_user
      password: !secret proxmox_pass
      command: "sensors | grep 'Package id 0:' | cut -c17-20"
      value_template: >-
        {%- set line = value.split("\r\n") -%}
        {{ line[1] }}
      unit_of_measurement: "ÂºC"
```
### Configuration Variables

**name**

  (string)(Optional) Friendly name of the sensor

**host**

  (string)(Required) The hostname or IP address of the remote server

**username**

  (string)(Required) A user on the remote server

**password**

(string)(Required) The password for the account

**port**

  (integer)(Optional) The port to ssh to
  Default value: 22

**command**

  (string)(Required) The command to execute on the remote server

**unit_of_measurement**

  (string)(Optional) Defines the units of measurement of the sensor

### Considerations

The sensor utilises the pexpect library https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ which mimics a user logging into the remote server via ssh. This results in the output being formatted as output from a tty terminal. Check out the pexecpt documentation for the oddities this causes.

A sensor value can only by a maximum of 256 characters in length, therefore make use of the value_template to parse data larger than this.
